<PRE>Good morning,
I will answer between your lines...

&gt;<i> I'm trying 0.4.3 and imported a large log of over 12,000 QSO's. I noticed
</I>&gt;<i> that some of the log entry details are NOT shown in the log section,
</I>&gt;<i> like name, locator, QSL sent/received. These details can only be seen
</I>&gt;<i> when you do a SEARCH for a particular callsign. Maybe the font of the
</I>&gt;<i> log section is too big, and I cannot show all the fields.
</I>I think that may be the problem, the fonts.
If you check the following screenshot:
<A HREF="http://jaime.robles.es/klog/imagen/klog-040sorting.png">http://jaime.robles.es/klog/imagen/klog-040sorting.png</A>

you will see that the name and locator is shown in the QSO/main tab for a
QSO.
It is not shown in the log tab... as I choosed not to do it. I thought
that showing all the data in the log would not be confortable. The way to
see all the data for one QSO is to &quot;edit&quot; (double-click) it. If you edit a
QSO, all the data for that QSO is shown in the edit tab.


&gt;<i> It would be nice to be able to show the DXCC or WAZ total for each BAND or
</I>&gt;<i> MODE, and to able to edit the DXCC or WAZ file from within the program,
</I>&gt;<i> as for example the WAZ is not always entered correctly from the log.
</I>Zone, continent, entity name and some others comes from the CTY.DAT file.
CTY.DAT file.

&gt;<i> Try entering UA0Y and you will see the ZONE is wrong in the INFO section.
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, UA0Y is zone 23.
</I>The best way to proceed with that, I think it is informing James
(<A HREF="http://www.country-files.com">http://www.country-files.com</A>) about this issue on the call UA0Y.
I will CC him this email and ask him to fix that. He usually answer fast! ;-)

&gt;<i> You need a ZONE field within the log input
</I>&gt;<i> as well, so when you enter the callsign in the log, it will always be
</I>&gt;<i> correct.
</I>I could do it, of course... maybe a zone input box... the main problem
with this is that this box would be usually left blank as the cty.dat file
is usually accurate for the most of the calls and the box would be usefull
just for a minimum number of calls... Any idea on this?


&gt;<i> You also need a DXCC field for the log input, as sometimes it will not be
</I>&gt;<i> correct from CTY.DAT. for example EA2BB/LH is shown as NORWAY, but if
</I>&gt;<i> there was a DXCC field, you could enter the correct DXCC entity.
</I>And.. if EA2BB/LH is not norway... what is it? A lighthouse??

Maybe I could add the &quot;/LH&quot; to the group of &quot;special prefixes&quot; like &quot;/P,
/J, /M, /MM, ...&quot; so it does not affect to the DXCC entity of the main
QRZ.
That way, EA2BB/LH would be Spain, EA and not Norway.

Would it be ok?
